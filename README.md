# bakeneko_weighted

First of all, this is a minor edit of kkatano's bakeneko. I am in no way affiliated with kkatano. He has graciously made this design open-source under the MIT license.

You may have seen my version of this board with the sacred geometry engraving on the back. These files have a blank weight, so there is no engraving.

Weight is 2mm and can be made with whatever you want. I chose brass.

All screw holes are tapped M2 holes.
Holes on the weight are countersunk 90 degrees.
I used M2x4 countersunk screws for the weight and M2x3 hex screws for the daughterboard.
