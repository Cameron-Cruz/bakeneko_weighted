# bakeneko_weighted

First of all, this is a minor edit of kkatano's bakeneko. I am in no way affiliated with kkatano. He has graciously made this design open-source under the MIT license.
You can learn more about it here: https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60


You may have seen my version of this board with the sacred geometry engraving on the back. These files have a blank weight, so there is no engraving.

Weight is 2mm and can be made with whatever you want. I chose brass.

If you ask "where did you get this made" I won't answer you. If you really want it, you will figure it out on your own.

All screw holes are tapped M2 holes.
Holes on the weight are countersunk 90 degrees.
I used M2x4 countersunk screws for the weight and M2x3 hex screws for the daughterboard.

# PCB

If you want to see PCB files, head over to kkatano's github.
Alternatively, you can buy a waffling60 from 4pplet
Or get one of Hadi's had60 rev1.1 pcbs

# Technical drawing

This is NOT THE EXACT technical drawing for this keyboard. This is the technical drawing for the default bakeneko, from which this keyboard is based off of.
This information is important because of the threaded inserts. Factories will want to know the specs for threaded holes (where the screws go).

The M2 in this drawing is what is used for both the daughterboard holes AND the back weight holes.
